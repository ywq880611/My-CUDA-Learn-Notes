# My-CUDA-Learn-Notes

This repo will contain some my hand-written kernel for CUDA practice.

The basic idea came from this [repo](https://github.com/DefTruth/CUDA-Learn-Notes).

All kernels list(marked as `done` means finished, not marked mean not need to write(easy)), I just pick some parts, which I though it's popular op, in the original repo:

### Easy:
- [x] Element wise
- [ ] Histogram
- [ ] Sigmoid
- [ ] Relu
- [ ] Gelu
- [x] Embedding
